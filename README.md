# Directory Tree Generator

A minimal tool that generates a directory structure including folders and optionally files of the folder in which it is executed.

This is the 1.0 version, rebuilt from scratch with more options and personalization icons representing file types, file and folder sizes, and some filtering options.

## What it does

- Recursively lists folders and files **starting from the current directory**
- Writes the directory tree to a **text file**
- **Mode selection:** Folders only or Folders + Files.
- **Sorts entries alphabetically**
- **File type icons:** Quickly identify file types (scripts, images, audio, video, archives, etc.).
- **Folder size calculation:** Displays total size of folders.

## Output

- A simple .txt file is generated in the current directory
- Filename format: "**folder name**_tree"
