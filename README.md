# Directory Tree Generator

The latest version can be downloaded from the [Released](https://github.com/RebelliousCat/Directory_Tree_Generator/releases) section.

A minimal tool that generates a textual directory tree of the folder in which it is executed.
This is the initial basic version, made quickly and used for some time. It will very likely be improved in the near future to meet specific needs.

This is the initial basic version that was made quickly and reused over time, without extra features or configuration.

## What it does

- Recursively lists folders and files starting from the current directory
- Writes the directory tree to a text file
- Sorts entries alphabetically
- Preserves folder hierarchy using tree-style indentation

## Output

- A simple .txt file is generated in the current directory
- Filename format: "**folder name**_tree"
